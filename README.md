# Victor Donte Data Analysis Portfolio
This is my portfolio for data analysis projects. These are mostly personal projects or freelance projects that I had the opportunity to partake in.
I will try to explain my thought process in building each individual projects
## Data analysis projects
### 1. 2023 General Election Analysis
In this project, I analyzed the 2023 Nigerian election dataset. I broke down my analysis into regional, state and party analysis and create chart and discovered patterns. My process of analysis began with the data cleaning and standardization process, I then proceeded to exploratory data analysis, uncovering patterns and outliers.
### 2. ZodiacCompatibility
This is a fun project. It compares the zodiac signs and checks how compatible they are with each other. I got the dataset from Kaggle and decided to work on it. Most of the work was done on python using numpy, pandas  and matplotlib libraries.
