## Data analysis projects
### 1. 2023 General Election Analysis
In this project, I analyzed the 2023 Nigerian election dataset. I broke down my analysis into regional, state and party analysis and create chart and discovered patterns. My process of analysis began with the data cleaning and standardization process, I then proceeded to exploratory data analysis, uncovering patterns and outliers.
